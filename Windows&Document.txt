Difference between Document and Window objects

Document Object :
         The Document object represents the web page that is loaded in to the browser.
By Accessing the Document object we can access the element in the HTML page. With the 
help of the document object we can add dynamic content to our web page.
         DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each brance of the tree ends in a
node and each node contains an objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree.
With that you can change the document's structure, style or content.

DOM Interfaces:
         1.abortController
         2.abortSignal
         3.abstarctRange
         4.attr
         5.domError
         6.customEvent etc.
         

Window Object:
          The Window object is the top most object in the DOM hierarchy. The Window interface
represents the window containing the DOM document. The document property points to the DOM
DOM document loaded in to that window.
          The global variable window is represents the window in which script is running and
exposed to the Javascript code. The window interface is a home to a variety of functions,
namespaces, objects and constructors which are not necessarily directly associated with the
concept of a user interface window. However the window interface is a suitable place to include
these items which needs to be globally available.

Properties of window obeject:
          Below are the few properties of window object.
        1.window.caches
        2.window.clientInformation
